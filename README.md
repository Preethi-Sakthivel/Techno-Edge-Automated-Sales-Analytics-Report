Automated Email-Based Sales Reporting Dashboard 

Project Purpose & Overview:

This project aimed to streamline and automate the data integration, transformation, and visualization pipeline for a top Indian fintech company that previously relied on manual reporting processes involving hourly email data downloads, Excel-based aggregation, and stakeholder communication. The solution was implemented entirely in Microsoft Power BI, leveraging Power Query and Power BI Service to enable real-time reporting without human intervention.

üîªBusiness Problem:

The company incurred significant time and cost (estimated at ‚Çπ3 million annually) due to repetitive manual workflows, which included:

‚Ä¢	Manual cleaning and combining of data in Excel

‚Ä¢	Creating visuals and manually sending performance numbers to stakeholders
This inefficiency resulted in a loss of 240 working hours per person per year, or approximately 30 business days (1.25 months), leading to high operational overhead.
